# Tic-Tac-Toe
This program simulates the Tic-Tac-Toe board game with graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. There are two different game modes: single-player and multiplayer. For the single-player mode, an artificial intelligence (AI) was implemented using the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. Hence, the AI is unbeatable. Either the AI wins or the game ends in a draw. Furthermore, the Alpha-beta pruning search algorithm was implemented to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.
